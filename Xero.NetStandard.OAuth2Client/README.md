# Xero .Net OAuth Client SDK

This package will allow you to connect to Xero using OAuth2 and the authorisation code flow. It will build you a login URL, redirect your user, take the code and state to get an accessToken and finally get tenants. 

Use Nuget to download the package
```
dotnet add package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2Client

```
or using the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio

```
Install-Package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2Client
```
or you can download the source code from https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-NetStandard and compile it by yourself.


### Create a Xero App
Follow these steps to create your Xero app

* Create a free Xero user account (if you don't have one)
* Use this URL for beta access to oAuth2 [https://developer.xero.com/myapps?code=oauth2create](https://developer.xero.com/myapps?code=oauth2create)
* Click "or Try oAuth2" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url, and redirect URI (this is your callback url - localhost, etc)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

Build the login link
```csharp

XeroConfiguration xconfig = new XeroConfiguration(); 
    xconfig.ClientId = "yourClientId";
    xconfig.ClientSecret = "yourClientSecret";
    xconfig.CallbackUri = new Uri("https://localhost:5001") //default for standard webapi template
    xconfig.Scope = "openid profile email files accounting.transactions accounting.contacts offline_access";
    var client = new XeroClient(xconfig);
    //build login link
    Console.WriteLine(client.BuildLoginUri());
```

From here the user will be redirected to login, authorise access and get redirected back

On the way back you will get a parameter with code and state
* code
* state

```csharp

XeroConfiguration xeroConfig = new XeroConfiguration(); 
    xeroConfig.ClientId = "yourClientId";
    xeroConfig.ClientSecret = "yourClientSecret";
    xeroConfig.CallbackUri = new Uri("https://localhost:5001") //default for standard webapi template
    xeroConfig.Scope = "openid profile email files accounting.transactions accounting.contacts offline_access";
    var client = new XeroClient(xeroConfig);
    //before getting the access token please check that the state matches
    await client.RequestAccessTokenAsync(code, "yourState");
    //from here you will need to access your Xero Tenants
    List<Tenant> tenants = await client.GetConnections();
    // you will now have the tenant id and access token
    foreach (Tenant tenant in tenants)
    {
        // do something with your tenant and access token
        //client.AccessToken;
        //tenant.TenantId;
    }

```


To setup the main API object see the snippet below

```csharp
//
var AccountingApi = new AccountingApi();
var response = await AccountingApi.GetInvoicesAsync(accessToken, xeroTenantId);
Console.WriteLine(AccountingApi.GetInvoices().ToJson();)

```
