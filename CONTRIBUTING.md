# Contributing to Xero-NetStandard
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use OpenAPI Generator
The best way to propose changes to the codebase is to open an [issue](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Java/issues) to discuss.  

We are using [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and [our OpenAPI specs](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-OpenAPI), to create and update our models and client classes.  Improvements may require updates to our OAS or our customized mustache templates.

We welcome your feedback and will work with you to incorporate them. (via generated code or pull request):

Sometimes, a pull request is the best way to communicate a change. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed implementation, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-NetStandard/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## General Support inquires
[Submit requests for support](https://developer.xero.com/contact-xero-developer-platform-support/) using this SDK or Xero's developer platform and APIs to our API Support team.

Please don't open GitHub issues for general support - we will be closing these and directing you to submit via the developer platform support form.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
